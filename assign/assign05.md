title: "Assignment 5: Binary Search Tree"
---

<br>

This assignment will implement a binary search tree that stores arbitrary objects via class templates. The tree will 
dynamically allocate nodes as necessary for space efficiency.



<br>

### Getting Started

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

If you don't already have one, create a directory on your **H:** drive named **CS350** (or anywhere else you choose). 
Navigate into this new directory and create a subdirectory named **assignments**.

Download [BST.zip](BST.zip), saving it into the **assignments** directory. 

Double-click on **BST.zip** and extract the contents of the archive into a subdirectory called **BST**.

For this assignment, a static library has been provided (containing working versions of each method) to allow for testing of 
each class method independently. Any unimplemented methods in **BST.cpp** will use the corresponding method from the 
library, thus you can implement the methods in any order. Be sure to test each method you implement individually against 
the library for proper operation which can be accomplished by uncommenting the appropriate **```#define```** in 
the file **Flags.h** (and commenting the line containing **```#define ALL 1```**).  
**DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE OTHER ```.h``` FILES INCLUDED WITH THE ASSIGNMENT**.
 
The class declaration is 

```cpp
	template <class T>
	class BST
	{
	public:
		// Constructor, destructor
		BST();
		~BST();
    
		// Public interface
		bool isEmpty();
		bool find(const T & x);
		const T & findMin();
		const T & findMax();
		void insert(const T & x);
		void remove(const T & x);
		void makeEmpty();
		void printTree();
		    
		// Root node (Private)
		Node<T> *root;
		int numNodes;
	
		// Utility methods (Private)
		Node<T> * findNode(Node<T> * node, const T & x);
		Node<T> * findMinNode(Node<T> * node);
		Node<T> * findMaxNode(Node<T> * node);
		Node<T> * findSuccessor(Node<T> * node);
		Node<T> * findParentOf(const T & x);
		Node<T> * insertNode(Node<T> * node, const T & x);
		void removeAllNodes(Node<T> * node);
		void printNodesInOrder(Node<T> * node);
	};
```

**NOTE:** Use **nullptr** for any null pointers.



<br>

### 1. Constructor / Destructor

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Since the tree will grow dynamically as needed, the constructor simply needs to initialize the root node. The destructor 
will subsequently need to remove any nodes in the tree.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to **```BST()```** (in **```BST.cpp```**) to initialize the **```root```** pointer and set the number of 
  nodes appropriately.  Note: At this point we *do not* need to dynamically allocate a node since we have not actually 
  inserted any values into the tree.
  
  - Add code to **```~BST()```** (in **```BST.cpp```**) to free all **```Node```**s in the tree.  Note: This operation 
  will also free the root node (if it contains a value) thus we should not separately deallocate the root since it was 
  not dynamically allocated in the constructor.



<br>

### 2. IsEmpty()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

A public method which simply returns a boolean indicating whether or not the current tree contains any valid nodes.
	
**Tasks**

  - Add a method named **```isEmpty()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes no parameters 
  and returns a **```bool```** indicating *true* if the tree contains no nodes. Hint: Consider what **```root```** 
  points to in the case of an empty tree.



<br>

### 3. Find() / FindNode() [ *Recursive* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

The find operation can be implemented in a recursive fashion according to the following rules starting at the root:


    1. If the node is **NULL** then terminate the search returning **false**, i.e. the value is not found.
    2. If the value in the node is equal to the desired value then terminate the search returning **true**, i.e. the value is found.
    3. If the search value is *less than* the value in the node, then recurse to the *left* child.
    4. If the search value is *greater than* the value in the node, then recurse to the *right* child.


**Tasks**

  - Add a method named **```find()```** that returns a **```bool```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) 
  that takes a single **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object parameter and determines if the value is in the 
  tree. Hint: Consider using the **```findNode()```** method passing the **```root```** as an argument.
  
  - Add a method named **```findNode()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a *pointer* to 
  a **```Node```** indicating the starting node for the search and a single **```const```** reference to a **```T```** 
  object parameter and returns a *pointer* to a **```Nod```e** that contains the desired value. Pseudocode for this 
  *recursive* routine is given as

```
FIND-NODE(n, k)
1  if n == NULL or k == n.key
2     return n
3  else if k < n.key
4     return FIND-NODE(n.left, k)
5  else 
6     return FIND-NODE(n.right, k)
```



<br>

### 4. FindMin() / FindMinNode() [ *Recursive* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Finding the minimum value in a binary search tree simply involves recursing down the left branches until a leaf node is 
reached (which will be the minimum by the binary search tree invariants).

**Tasks**

  - Add a method named **```findMin()```** that returns a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object indicating 
  the minimum value (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) and takes no parameters. If no minimum value exists 
  (i.e. the tree is empty) your **```findMin()```** method should throw an exception as shown here: **```throw 1;```**.  
  Hint: Consider using the **```findMinNode()```** method passing the **```root```** as an argument
  
  - Add a method named **```findMinNode()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a *pointer* 
  to a **```Node```** as a parameter for the starting point and returns a *pointer* to a **```Node```** that contains 
  the minimum value. Pseudocode for this *recursive* routine is given as

```
FIND-MINIMUM-NODE(n)
1  if n.left == NULL
2     return n
3  else 
4     return FIND-MINIMUM-NODE(n.left)
```



<br>

### 5. FindMax() / FindMaxNode() [ *Recursive* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Finding the maximum value in a binary search tree simply involves recursing down the right branches until a leaf node 
is reached (which will be the maximum by the binary search tree invariants).

**Tasks**

  - Add a method named **```findMax()```** that returns a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object indicating 
  the maximum value (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) and takes no parameters. If no maximum value exists 
  (i.e. the tree is empty) your **```findMax()```** method should throw an exception as shown here: **```throw 1;```**.  
  Hint: Consider using the **```findMaxNode()```** method passing the **```root```** as an argument. 
  
  - Add a method named **```findMaxNode()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a *pointer* 
  to a **```Node```** as a parameter for the starting point and returns a *pointer* to a **```Node```** that contains 
  the maximum value. Pseudocode for this *recursive* routine is given as

```
FIND-MAXIMUM-NODE(n)
1  if n.right == NULL
2     return n
3  else
4     return FIND-MAXIMUM-NODE(n.right)
```



<br>

### 6. Insert() / InsertNode() [ *Recursive* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

To insert a value into a binary search tree (assuming it does not exist), which must occur at a leaf, a recursive 
procedure similar to search is performed until a **```nullptr```** child is reached. Then the respective child pointers 
are assigned as the recursion unrolls.

**Tasks**

  - Add a **```void```** method named **```insert()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes 
  a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object parameter and inserts a **```Node```** containing the data at the 
  appropriate place in the tree.  Hint: Consider using the **```insertNode()```** method passing the **```root```** as 
  an argument. Since we are **not** using a sentinel root node, also consider how to handle the case where we are trying 
  to insert into an empty tree. 

  - Add a method named **```insertNode()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a *pointer* 
  to a **```Node```** for the starting point and a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object as parameters and 
  returns a *pointer* to a **```Node```**. A Java implementation for this *recursive* routine can be found in the notes 
  for [Binary Search Trees](../lectures/Binary_Search_Trees.pdf). Finally, be sure to increment the **```numNodes```** 
  field if a new node is successfully inserted into the tree.



<br>

### 7. FindSuccessor() / FindParentOf() [ *Iterative* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Two useful utility routines for **```remove()```** are a method to find the successor of a given node and a method to 
find the parent of a given node. 

**```FindSuccessor()```**

The *successor* node is the one with the *smallest* value in the node's *right* subtree. Hence, **```FindSuccessor()```** 
simply starts at the node's *right child* and continually follows the left branches until the minimum node is found.


**```FindParentOf()```**

Finding the parent node for a given value involves a similar process as searching except that the search terminates when 
one of the *child* nodes of the current node contains the desired value (or both children are **```nullptr```** indicating 
the value is not in the tree).

**Tasks**

  - Add a method named **```findSuccessor()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a *pointer* 
  to a **```Node```** indicating the starting point and returns a *pointer* to a **```Node```** for the successor to that 
  starting node. Write an *iterative* method that begins at the starting node's **```right```** child and follows the 
  **```left```** children as far as possible down the tree.

  - Add a method named **```findParentOf()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes a 
  a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object as a parameter and returns a *pointer* to a **```Node```** which 
  is the *parent* of the node containing the parameter value. Write the method such that it begins at the **```root```** 
  and performs an *iterative* search until the *child* of the current node contains the desired value (at which point 
  the current node is the *parent*).  Since the **```root```** node has no parent, return **```nullptr```** when its parent
  is requested.



<br>

### 8. Remove()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

The process for removal of a node from a binary search tree depends on one of four cases:


    1. Case 1: The value to remove is not in the tree - do nothing.
    2. Case 2: The node to remove has *no children*, i.e. is a leaf node - simply remove the node
    3. Case 3: The node to remove has *one child* - replace the node with its child
    4. Case 4: The node to remove has *two children* - replace the node with its *successor*


**Tasks**

  * Add a **```void```** method named **```remove()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that takes 
  a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object parameter and removes the node that contains the given value (or 
  does nothing if the value does not exist in the list). Hints:

	- For *Case 1*: do nothing. 
	
	- For *Case 2*: the *child* pointer of the *parent* of the node containing the desired value needs to be updated, 
	consider using the **```findParentOf()```** method.
	 
	- For *Case 3*: a strategy is to replace the *value* in the node to be deleted with the *value* in its (single) child, 
	reassign the node's *pointers* to reference the *child*s subtrees, and then deallocate the *child* node.
	
	- For *Case 4*: first find the *successor* node (consider using the **```findSuccessor()```** method which must be 
	valid since we know the node has two children in this case), copy the successor's data into the current node, and 
	then *remove* the successor (which must have either zero children or one right child).
	
	- Be sure to decrement the **```numNodes```** field if a node is successfully removed from the tree. 



<br>

### 9. MakeEmpty() / RemoveAllNodes() [ *Recursive* ]

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Deallocation of all the nodes in the tree can be done via a *post-order* traversal, i.e. once both child subtrees are 
deallocated we can deallocate the root.
	
**Tasks**

  - Add a **```void```** method named **```makeEmpty()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that 
  takes no parameters and deallocates all nodes from the tree.  Hint: Consider using the **```removeAllNodes()```** 
  method. Be sure to reset the tree fields, such as **``numNodes``** and **``root``**, appropriately.
  
  - Add a **```void```** method named **```removeAllNodes()```** (do not forget to qualify it with the class name) that 
  takes a *pointer* to a **```Node```** representing the root of the subtree and implements a *recursive post-order* 
  traversal of the tree that deallocates leaf nodes.  A Java implementation of post-order traversal can be found in the 
  notes for [Tree Traversal](../lectures/Tree_Traversal_lecture.pdf). Don't forget to decrement the **``numNodes``**
  counter for each **``Node``** that you delete. Don't worry about reseting the **``root``** pointer in this method,
  you can do that in **``makeEmpty()``**.



<br>

### 10. Compiling and running the program

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Once you have completed implementing any of the above methods (the remaining unimplemented methods will be drawn from the 
static library):

**In CLion:**  
From the "Run" menu, select "Run" (or click the "Run" button in the top right of the IDE)

**In the terminal:**  
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the command **```make```** to compile.

Run the command **```./BST```**.

Congratulations, you have just implemented a binary search tree C++ data structure with templates!



<br>
    
### 11. Testing your data structure
    
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
    
The test program that is distributed with this programming assignment (**```tests.cpp```**) includes a variety of 
tests to verify the functionality of your newly created data structure.  However, the tests that are included with 
this assignment are not necessarily extensive and may not test all of the edge cases for your data structure. 

Part of developing any piece of software is creating the tests required to ensure correctness.  You should 
add any tests necessary to ensure complete correctness of your data structure. A good place to start is to
consider edge cases:

 - What happens when each method is called on an empty data structure?
 - What happens when each method is called on a full data structure?
 - What happens when each method is called on a data structure that has a single element?
 
**Be assured, that when your programming assignment is graded these edge cases (and more) will be tested.**

The testing framework used in **```tests.cpp```** in called [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch). 
Documentation can be found on the [Catch website](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch). 



<br>
    
### 12. Checking for memory leaks
    
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
    
Memory leaks are the result of memory that is allocated but not properly freed.  In C++, each
time you use the **```new```** keyword you are allocating memory.  All instances of **```new```** 
should have a corresponding instance of **```delete```** to free the memory that was allocated.
This can be trickier than it sounds. Thankfully, there are tools such as [**```valgrind```**](http://valgrind.org) 
that can automatically analyze your program and detect these types of errors.

To check your program for memory leaks, 

**In CLion:**  
From the "Run" menu, select "Run ... with Valgrind Memcheck" (or click the "Memcheck" button in the top right of the IDE)

**In the terminal:**  
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the command **```make memcheck```** from the command line.

Fix any memory leaks that are detected.
